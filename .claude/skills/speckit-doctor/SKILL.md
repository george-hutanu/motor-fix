## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Why this exists

A gate that fails is loud. A gate that stopped *firing* is silent — a renamed
hook script, a settings entry pointing at an id nobody registered, an exemption
in `.specify/trace-baseline.json` for a feature that was deleted a month ago.
Every one of those leaves the suite green and the rule unenforced. This command
is the periodic check for that class of failure.

## Phase 1 — Report (always)

Run:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/doctor.mjs
```

Read the output and report it to the user grouped by severity, **not** as a
transcript dump:

- `✗ fail` — a gate is broken or unenforced right now. Say which rule is not
  being applied, in plain words ("edits to src/ are no longer test-gated"), not
  just the check name.
- `! warn` — drift that is not yet a hole: stale permissions, dead exemptions,
  unregistered hook scripts, missing Python.
- `✓ ok` — summarise as a count. Do not list them.

If every check passes, say so in one line and stop. Do not invent work.

## Phase 2 — Repair (only when asked, one at a time)

Only when the user asks for a fix (or passes `fix`). For each finding, propose
the smallest change and name what it affects:

| Finding | Repair |
|---|---|
| `hooks/fingerprints` stale | **Read the diff of that gate script first** (`git diff -- .claude/hooks/<script>`). A change that weakens a gate is a finding to report, not a fingerprint to bless. Only when the change is legitimate: `node .claude/scripts/doctor.mjs --bless-hooks` |
| `hooks/wiring` mismatch | Add the missing id to `.claude/settings.json`, or delete the entry that names an unknown id |
| `hooks/scripts` missing | Restore the script from git, or remove its registry entry if the gate was retired on purpose |
| `hooks/orphans` | Register the script, or delete it — an unregistered hook script runs from nowhere |
| `feature/pointer` broken | Rewrite `.specify/feature.json` to the real feature directory, or delete the file |
| `feature/baseline` dead entries | Delete them from `.specify/trace-baseline.json`. Never add one to make a gate pass |
| `skills/frontmatter`, `agents/frontmatter` | Fix the frontmatter so `name` matches the directory or filename |
| `commands/permissions` stale | Remove the allow-list entry for the deleted script |
| `commands/python` missing | Report it; installing Python is the user's call, not an edit to make |

Re-run `node .claude/scripts/doctor.mjs` after the repairs and show the new counts.

## Rules

- Never bless a fingerprint you have not read the diff for. The whole point of
  the fingerprint is that weakening a gate requires editing its script.
- Never "fix" a failure by deleting the check, relaxing a threshold, or adding
  a baseline exemption. Those are the moves this command exists to detect.
- `--check` (exit 1 on any failure) and `--json` are for
  `.specify/scripts/bash/routine-verify.sh` and unattended runs.

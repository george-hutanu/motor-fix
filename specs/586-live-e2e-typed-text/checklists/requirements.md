# Specification Quality Checklist: Typed-text step in the live end-to-end test

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- A test-only task: the "no implementation details" items are read as "no more than the suite, dialog and labels the check must name"; the file and label names are the task's subject, not a leak.
- Clarifications answered autonomously (gate override): new test vs rewrite, which field, never submitted; each is an (autonomous default) line under Assumptions.

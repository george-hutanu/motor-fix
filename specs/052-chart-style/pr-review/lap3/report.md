| # | Severity | Finding | Where | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | medium | api readiness: storage down |  |  |
| 2 | medium | Accessibility (moderate): landmark-one-main — Document should have one main landmark (1 element) | / · desktop · light · ro (+11 more) | shots/home-desktop-light-ro.png |
| 3 | medium | Accessibility (moderate): region — All page content should be contained by landmarks (2 elements) | / · desktop · light · ro (+11 more) | shots/home-desktop-light-ro.png |

### Reproduction
1. No object store on this machine (no Docker); every other check is ok. Environment limit, not the change.
2. Open / at the desktop viewport (1440×900), light colour scheme, language ro. → Run axe-core on the page: rule landmark-one-main on html. → Observe: Accessibility (moderate): landmark-one-main — Document should have one main landmark (1 element).
3. Open / at the desktop viewport (1440×900), light colour scheme, language ro. → Run axe-core on the page: rule region on p:nth-child(2). → Observe: Accessibility (moderate): region — All page content should be contained by landmarks (2 elements).

Screenshots: 24, one per route × viewport × scheme × language.
